This repository contains my coding output in response to a coding challenge set in June 2013 by Evgeny Shadchnev at Makers Academy.

The Task

Let's create an app that allows the user to keep the count of how many times they logged into the app. Not terribly useful but good for practice.

It will have the following functionality:

The homepage will explain what the app does and have login and sign up forms

The sign up form will be submitted via ajax using JQuery

If the sign up is successful, it'll show the corresponding message (as part of the page)

If the sign up is not successful (empty username or password, duplicate username), it will show a message as well.

The user should be able to log in after it has signed up. A successful login will redirect to another page that will show the count of how many times the user has logged in

An unsuccessul login will show an error message without reloading the page

This page will have a log out button or link. If the user clicks it a message will sho saying goodbye

It a user is already logged in, the home page should automatically redirect to the logged in page

Implementation

Please have acceptance tests for the app. Write them first.

Use bcrypt, hasing and salting to manage the password of the user

Use either postgres or mongoid as the database. Use either mongoid or datamapper.

Use a cookie with a custom secret key

Set your cookie to be http-only

Deploy to heroku. Make sure it works there (you'll need to add necessary add ons).

Validate your HTML with http://validator.w3.org/. Try to fix the errors it may show

Validate your CSS with http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/. Try to fix the errors it may show.

Validate your JS with http://www.jslint.com/. Try to fix the errors it may show

Finally, make your app good. It's just a couple of pages with the most basic functionality. Make an attempt at web design but don't overcomplicate it.
